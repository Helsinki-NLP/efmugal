Efficient Multilingual Gibbs Aligner

This is an implementation of an improved version of
[Ã–stling (2014)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E/E14/E14-4024.pdf),
using a partially collapsed sampler for better parallelization.

It is currently under development, and more information should appear soon.
